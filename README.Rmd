#Sparse supervised k-means clustering
Supervised (and unsupervised) sparse k-means clustering, with single-cell RNA-seq data in mind.  The clustering can be performed using either a traditional (squared) euclidean distance, or via a dissimilarity matrix that takes into account the drop-out phenomenom in single-cell RNA-seq data. The dissimilarity measure is obtained through the single-cell analysis package CIDR*.

*For more details about _CIDR_, refer to the [github page](https://github.com/VCCRI/CIDR) or the  [paper](https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-017-1188-0): 
Peijie Lin, Michael Troup, Joshua W.K. Ho, CIDR: Ultrafast and accurate clustering through imputation for single-cell RNA-seq data. _Genome Biology_ 2017 Mar 28;18(1):59.

_scluster_ is maintained by Dr Joshua Ho j.ho@victorchang.edu.au.

##Getting Started

* Make sure your version of R is at least 3.1.0.
* _scluster_ and _CIDR_ have been tested primarily on the Linux and Mac platforms.  _CIDR_ has also been tested on the Windows platform - however this requires the use of an external software package _Rtools_.
* If you are on the Windows platorm, ensure that [Rtools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/) is installed. Rtools is software (installed external to R) that assists in building R packages, and R itself.  Note that the downlaod for _Rtools_ is in the order of 100M.
* Install the CRAN package _devtools_ package which will be used to install _CIDR_ and its dependencies:
```{r, eval=F}
## this is an R command
install.packages("devtools")
```

* Install the _CIDR_ and _scluster_ packages directly from the Github repository (including any dependencies):

```{r, eval=F}
## this is an R command
devtools::install_github("VCCRI/CIDR")
devtools::install_github("VCCRI/scluster")
## Note that for some Windows platforms, you may be asked to re-install RTools
## - even though it may already have been installed.  Say yes if prompted.
## Your windows platform may require the specific version of RTools being suggested.
##
## For Mac platforms, ensure that the software "Xcode" and "Command Line Tools" are
## installed, by issuing the following command from a terminal prompt:
##  /usr/bin/clang --version
##
```

#Examples
##Simulated Data
Test the newly installed _scluster_ package:

```{r}
library(scluster)
example("scluster")
```

##Biological Datasets
Examples of applying _CIDR_ to real biological datasets can be found at this [Github repository](https://github.com/VCCRI/CIDR-examples).  The name of the repository is _CIDR-examples_.  The interested user may use these resources to test _scluster_. 

Clicking on the _Clone or Download_ button in the Github repository for _CIDR-examples_ will enable the user to download a zip file containing the raw biological data and the R files for the examples.  The user can then extract the files and run the provided R examples.

###Human Brain scRNA-Seq Dataset
_CIDR-examples_ contains a human brain single-cell RNA-Seq dataset, located in the _Brain_ folder. In this dataset
there are 420 cells in 8 cell types after we exclude hybrid cells.  

Reference for the human brain dataset:

Darmanis, S. _et al._ A survey of human brain transcriptome diversity at the single cell level.
_Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences_ 112, 7285–7290 (2015).

###Human Pancreatic Islet scRNA-Seq Dataset
_CIDR-examples_ contains a human pancreatic islet single-cell RNA-Seq dataset, located in the _PancreaticIslet_ folder. In this dataset there are 60 cells in 6 cell types after we exclude undefined cells and bulk RNA-Seq samples.  

Reference for the human pancreatic islet dataset:

Li, J. _et al._ Single-cell transcriptomes reveal characteristic features of human pancreatic islet
cell types. _EMBO Reports_ 17, 178–187 (2016).

##Troubleshooting
###Masking of _hclust_
_CIDR_ utilises the _hclust_ function from the base _stats_ package.  Loading _CIDR_ masks _hclust_ in other packages automatically. 
However, if any package with an _hclust_ function (e.g., _flashClust_) is loaded after _CIDR_, the name clashing can possibly cause a problem.
In this case unloading that package should resolve the issue.

###Reinstallation of _CIDR_ - cidr.rdb corruption
In some cases when installing a new version of _CIDR_ on top of an existing version may result in the following error message:

```Error in fetch(key) : lazy-load database '/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/3.3/Resources/library/cidr/help/cidr.rdb' is corrupt```

In this case, one way to resolve this issue is to reinstall the _devtools_ package:
```{r, eval=F}
install.packages("devtools")
## Click “Yes” in “Updating Loaded Packages”
devtools::install_github("VCCRI/CIDR",force=TRUE)
```
Some users might have installed an older version of RcppEigen. CIDR requires RcppEigen version >=0.3.2.9.0. Please re-install the latest version of this package if necessary.
